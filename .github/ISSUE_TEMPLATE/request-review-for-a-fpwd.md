The Privacy IG prefers groups to complete a self-review around the time of FPWD. See https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/.

If you still want us to review your spec, please provide the information below.

In the issue title above add the document name followed by the date of this request.

- name of spec to be reviewed:
- URL of spec: [This must be a dated version in the TR namespace, not an editor's draft.]
- Does your document have an in-line Privacy Considerations section, ideally one separate from Security Considerations?  If not, correct that before proceeding further.
- Do you need a reply by a particular date?
- Please point to the results of your own self-review (see https://w3ctag.github.io/security-questionnaire/ , https://w3c.github.io/fingerprinting-guidance/, https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6973)
- Where and how to file issues arising?
- Pointer to any explainer for the spec?

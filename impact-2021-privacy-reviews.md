Here is a place to make notes of the impact 2021 PING privacy reviews and other guidance/engagement with WGs:
* Privacy review - [Web Neural Network API](https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/) - the draft spec now includes a permissions policy integration, namely restricting the API to first-party contexts via default allowlists, see 7.2.1 in https://www.w3.org/TR/webnn/ and https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions-policy/#default-allowlist (as well as the discussion in [issue 145](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn/issues/145))
* Other - Ambient Light Sensor API - the WG resolved on 29 October 2021 to make Ambient Light Sensor API data granularity normative - see https://www.w3.org/2021/10/29-dap-minutes.html#r02
